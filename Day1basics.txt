1️⃣ What actually happens when you run a Java program? (DEEP)

When you write:

public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

The process:
Step 1 – Compilation (Source → Bytecode)
Hello.java  → javac compiler → Hello.class


.java = human readable

.class = bytecode (JVM readable)

Step 2 – JVM loads bytecode

JVM has 3 main parts:

Class Loader → loads .class

JIT Compiler → compiles frequently used code into native code

Garbage Collector → removes unused objects

Step 3 – Execution

JVM reads bytecode line by line

Executes it inside the OS

✔ This is what makes Java platform independent.
